### Summary

Some wall art for all the DnD fans out there, including my daughter.

If you use the provided guides for spacing the end product is about 15" x 15" (38cm x 38cm). 

I used Protopasta's Iron-filled Metal Composite PLA

and rusted the pieces before sanding and polishing the tops.  A light coat of spray polyurethane was added so the rust doesn't come off on finger or the wall, but I'm honestly not sure if I like the way the coating looks (they were pretty cool looking with the rust showing, while the finish makes it look kind of painted on).

3M Command strips were used for mounting.

Have fun!


### Print Settings

At full size, this required a full 1kg of iron-filled filament (that is, two 500g spools used thoughtfully to minimize spool leftovers) at the following settings:

 - Rafts      :  No                   
 - Supports   :  No                   
 - Nozzle     :  0.6mm                
 - Resolution :  0.2                
 - Line Width :  0.5                 
 - Infill     :  20% with 1 infill step
 - Bottom     :  4 layers
 - Top        :  8 layers
 - Walls      :  3

I used saturated salt in vinegar with added peroxide in a heated area over the course of a week.  After the final sanding I sprayed with just peroxide and let them sit overnight, which added a layer of rust to the sanded areas that I polished off using a cloth wheel.  ymmv :)
