### Summary

I purchased a dual z-axis upgrade kit and the product had some tolerance issues - the z-axis mount wasn't square and the stator housing exceeded the width of the end caps.  The net result was a complete inability to mount the stepper motor square and align things properly.

This is an entire kit of mounts and tools to remedy those issues, including:

  o A simple z-axis motor mount with a bit more clearance so that the motor doesn't quite touch the z-axis rails

  o A set of adjustable leveling brackets for the other side of the stepper motor

  o A combined mount + leveling bracket (as an alternative to using separate parts)

  o Some simple washers to account for the distance difference in the x-axis roller bracket assembly

  o An adjustable spacer measuring jig for the z-axis rod lead screw

  o A simple x-axis rail level

The stepper motor leveling brackets require some hardware:

  o 2 M3x6 screws
  o 2 M3x16 screws
  o 2 M3x6x10 threaded inserts

You can see in the photos how it's all set up, but it's pretty self explanatory.  You can use the mount+bracket combo if you're adding a new stepper motor, or just add the outer leveling bracket if you want to use existing mounts.

The spacer jig is really handy, and I use the x-axis level all the time.

I'm particularly fond of the bottom bracket, which I consistenly refer to as the TRON Recognizer.

I used https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4699747 as the base for the design, but pretty much tore it apart.  The concept for the leveling brackets were inspired by https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4073953, which is a great idea but had too many nuts and bolts for me :)

Anyway, all these things helped me tune the upgrade kit, and I ended up applying it to the original setup as well.  Smooth as silk now.

As always, ymmv.
