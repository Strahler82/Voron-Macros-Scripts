# Voron 2.4 models, modifications, etc
###### some functional and aesthetic Voron 2.4 modifications...

- [blower_housing_rear.stl](stl/blower_housing_rear.stl) - fix for [Voron-Afterburner issue #13](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Afterburner/issues/13) that allows for additional clearance for the blower wires in the rear housing
- [reverse-screws-nozzle_probe.stl](stl/reverse-screws-nozzle_probe.stl) - allows for screwing down the z-endstop [nozzle probe](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/blob/Voron2.4/STLs/VORON2.4/Z_Endstop/nozzle_probe.stl) from the opposite side so that you don't have to worry about touching the microswitch wires to the screw heads 
- [z-drive-main_side-inserts.stl](stl/z-drive-main_side-inserts.stl) - some push-in bling for the side of the z-drive housing

more to come...
