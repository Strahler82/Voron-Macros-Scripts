#### some functional and aesthetic Voron 2.4 modifications...

---

| modifications to core parts | |
| :--- | :--- |
| [`blower_housing_rear.stl`](stl/blower_housing_rear.stl) | fix for [Voron-Afterburner issue #13](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Afterburner/issues/13) that adds additional clearance for the blower wires in the rear housing |
| [`nozzle_probe.stl`](stl/nozzle_probe.stl) | allows for screwing down the z-endstop [`nozzle_probe.stl`](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/blob/Voron2.4/STLs/VORON2.4/Z_Endstop/nozzle_probe.stl) from the opposite side so that you don't have to worry about the microswitch wires touching the screw heads.  both the self-tapping BOM or standard M2x10 screws work |
| [`side_fan_support.stl`](stl/side_fan_support.stl) | [`side_fan_support_x2.stl`](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/blob/Voron2.4/STLs/VORON2.4/Skirts/side_fan_support_x2.stl) mount points for the skirt cooling fans. personally, I tapped M5 holes in the fans.  ymmv. |
| [`lgx_AftB_Mount_Front.STL`](stl/lgx_AftB_Mount_Front.STL) | minor adjustments to the [Bondtech LGX mount in Discord](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/635687829254701107/823914498700083220/lgx_AftB_Mount_Front.STL) that provides additional clearance for normal M3x20 screws so the toolhead mounts to the x carriage assembly properly |

| extras | |
| :-------------------------------- | :--- |
| [`z-drive-main_side-inserts.stl`](stl/z-drive-main_side-inserts.stl) | some push-in bling for the side of the z-drive housing |
| [`lever-cover.stl`](stl/lever-cover.stl) | drop-in replacement for the Bondtech LGX Extruder filament pre-tension lever |
| [`spool-holder/`](stl/spool-holder/) | modification of the core spool holder for roller bearings.  requires two 608zz bearings, two M3 threaded inserts, and two M3x16 screws |

more to come...
