## why?

filament buffers are hardâ„¢

I didn't realize how hard until I ventured down this path.

I started like most do, and loyally printed some [ercf carrot patch](https://github.com/EtteGit/EnragedRabbitProject/tree/main/Carrot_Patch) units.  space limitations required me to mount them overhead, which is where things started to go sideways - every time I needed to put in new filament I had to find a chair and fsck around with the confined carrot patch space, sharp edges, filament whiplash, and whatnot - all overhead - until my shoulders hurt, cursing the entire time.  I figured there had to be a better way...  

it turns out, there really isn't.  yes, there's the nifty [buffer array usermod](https://github.com/EtteGit/EnragedRabbitProject/tree/main/usermods/ERCF-Buffer-Array), which saves on space but doesn't remove what turned out to be my main source of frustration - not having direct access to the wheel.  this alone generated so much yelling the neighbors started to complain.  beyond the carrot patch and its variants, all the solutions seem to end in a single slot *hey lets shove the filament in this little space* approach.  given my 1200mm bowden path, those weren't poised to work out well unless I made them half a mile long.

all I wanted was a lightning-fast, super-simple, overhead-mounted, expletive-free, wheel-based, wicked-dependable filament buffer solution.  how hard could it be?

this thing here is where I ended up.

honestly, I'm surprised it actually works.

## assembly

hopefully, y'all find this pretty self explanatory, and can figure it out from the pictures.  basically, we have:

- a series of buffer slot slider thingies
- held together by a frame

that's about it.


### printing

a few things to note when printing...

- the models already oriented for optimal printing.  no parts have included supports to remove, nor are supports necessary for any part.  if there are overhangs that need support the part is oriented incorrectly.
- due to bending of large parts, you want to print the bottoms flat so that the latch fit is tight - you'll only be able to print 1 or two of these at a time.
- conversely, the tops are designed to be printed upright, so go ahead and fill your plate.  if you care about a good looking bottom overhang, keep your exterior perimeter fans at 100% and engage them starting on layer 2.
- I used 20% infill and .2mm layer height on the tops and bottoms in order to keep parts light and plastic use down.
- I would suggest printing the latches and bracket using standard voron parameters (40% infill, .2mm layers, 4 perimeters) for added strength.
- the screen with the posts works best with higher temps and lower fan to keep the layers as strong as possible, as the posts are thin and subject to cracking if you're not careful.


### BOM

hopefully this is a full, accurate list...

| PTFE/FEP 4mm OD x (2.5mm or 3.0mm ID) tubing       | variable     | variable     | variable      |

plus mounting hardware if you want to use the bottom bracket to mount the array on something.

m3x6 can be substituted for all the m3x8 with no detrimental effect - the holes are long enough for both.

| I used these 10x3 disc magnets [from amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZLFNZ4S), which don't seem to be available on amazon anymore.  you're looking for something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G88NZZV) - 10x3 disc magnets with a hole in the middle. | ![magnets](./images/magnets.png) |
| these m2x8 hex cap self threading screws [from amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00YBMRAH4) are really handy, both for this and other voron projects, like klicky. | ![screws](./images/screws.png) |



### array

currently, there are 6, 9, and 12 slot versions, though only the 9 slot is tested at this point in time.  the only parts that differ are the side
latches and bottom bracket, which are easy for me to modify (and for you to print) if they don't work - just let me know.

the wheel is same as the ercp wheel, except with a filament hole (with marker) for easier loading.  feel free to use the stock ercp wheel instead.


### tag plates

if you mount your buffer overhead your numbers will be upside down.  you can find upside down tag plates [here](../upside-down-numbers).


### other stuff

I mounted my ercf at 90 degrees using a french cleat system, which you can find [here](../mounts/ercf-french-cleat/).

the 90 degree mounting created some challenges accessing the filament block ecas connectors, so I made [an extension](../extender/) to help.

a magnetic bowden "bridge" (plus some springs) keeps my bowden tubes straight, clear, and managed.  available [here](../mounts/bridge/).

## credits

- the entire concept here started after seeing [this mmu buffer on printables.com](https://www.printables.com/model/30811-mmu-slot-buffer).  while my work isn't really a mod of that (I modeled everything myself from scratch), I did copy the latch concept nearly... verbatim?  I'm sure there's a word for it.  anyway, the latch works really well, and needless to say I coudn't have figured a mechanism like that on my own.  this project owes sincere credit and gratitude to all the work and effort over there.  many thanks!

- all the fittings and cutouts - ecas and m3 holes, bridging, etc - were taken directly from either the [ercf project](https://github.com/EtteGit/EnragedRabbitProject) or the [voron 2.4 project](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/).  since I use blender and don't cad, I really appreciate all the community work that has gone into getting those measurements and fit tricks just right.  kudos to team voron, be they enraged or not.

- the buffer wheel is taken right from [ercf project](https://github.com/EtteGit/EnragedRabbitProject).  no need to reinvent the wheel...

- [deepfriedhero](https://dfh.fm), [west3d](https://west3d.com), and [fabreeko](https://www.fabreeko.com) for consistently fantastic parts and service

- I'm super grateful for some early beta testers, who provided really valuable feedback:
  - `@TheTechRunner V2.1453 V0.1556`
  - `@ningj V2.2726`

- probably others - if you feel left out let me know :)
