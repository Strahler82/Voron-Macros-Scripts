# lgx stealthburner stuff...


everything is modeled on the last stealthburner beta, and has not been updated to reflect the general release (cosmetic) changes.  I'll get to that eventually.  until then...

### beta stuff:

| | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| cw1 mount | [front](beta/cw1/sb-lgx-front-cw1.stl), [rear](beta/cw1/sb-lgx-rear-cw1.stl) | |
| cw2 mount | [all in one](beta/cw2/sb-lgx-cw2-v5.stl) | |
| cable chain anchor | [here](beta/sb-lgx-anchor.stl) | |
| cover | [here](beta/sb-lgx-cover.stl) | I use a few plastic washers as spacers on the mount screw to keep it tight - the fit isn't snug on purpose, since it really depends on how much stuff you stuff in there... |
| ercf toolhead sensor mount | [here](beta/cw2/sb-lgx-cw2-ercf-v5.stl) | works well, and even better with a legit N52 magnet like you can find [here](https://deepfriedhero.in/products/n52-6x3mm-round-black-nickel-magnets).  I didn't port over the retaning screw - the lgx holds a properly heatshrink-applied hall effect sensor in snugly.  there's space for a bit of hot glue for extra holding (which is what I do) |
